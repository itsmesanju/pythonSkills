Keep two markers: read_index and write_index and point them to the end of the array. Letâ€™s take a look at an overview of the algorithm.

While moving read_index towards the start of the array:

If read_index points to 0, skip.
If read_index points to a non-zero value, write the value at read_index to write_index and decrement write_index.
Assign zeros to all the values before the write_index and to the current position of write_index as well.
